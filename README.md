# SpoilerAlert üîçü•ï

**Don't let recalls spoil your day.**

## What's This All About?

Have you ever gone shopping and almost bought recalled food, or discovered that item sitting in your fridge was part of a recent recall? With recalls becoming more frequent these days, we needed a better solution than manually checking barcodes or scrolling through endless FDA lists. That's why we created SpoilerAlert ; because we don't want recalls to spoil your day! Using computer vision and FDA's recall database, SpoilerAlert lets you quickly scan any food item to check if it's safe to buy or eat. Simple, fast, and reliable food safety right at your fingertips. We also let you know how many other people noticed if this recalled product is still for sale in your city, in order to raise awareness on the issue of food safety and food waste!

## Why SpoilerAlert? ü§î

This project was born from one of our team members going grocerry shopping with his girlfriend and realizing that a lot of produce was on the recall list. This got us wondering, have you ever grabbed something off the shelf without realizing it's been recalled? The rest of our team absolutely has, so we did something about it. SpoilerAlert makes sure you never have to worry about that again. Plus, with our community feature, you can help others find the good stuff when it's in stock.
