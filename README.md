# SpoilerAlert 🔍🥕

**Don't let recalls spoil your day.**

## What's This All About?

Have you ever gone shopping and almost bought recalled food, or discovered that item sitting in your fridge was part of a recent recall? With recalls becoming more frequent these days, we needed a better solution than manually checking barcodes or scrolling through endless FDA lists. That's why we created SpoilerAlert ; because we don't want recalls to spoil your day!
