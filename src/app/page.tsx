          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            SpoilerAlert is a smart tool designed to help you avoid hidden food recalls. It uses computer vision along with real-time FDA recall data to instantly check if a food product is safe to buy or consume.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            The key benefits include peace of mind when shopping and the assurance that you‚Äôre avoiding recalled products. This not only keeps you safe but also helps reduce food waste by preventing the purchase of items that should be avoided.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            The idea for SpoilerAlert came from a personal shopping trip where I was surprised to discover that many items on the shelves were on recall‚Äîhidden in plain sight. This experience inspired me to create a tool that makes food safety simple and accessible for everyone.
